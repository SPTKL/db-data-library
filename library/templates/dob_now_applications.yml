      DOB NOW job applications received from DOB via FTP which is hosted by Matt and manually moved to sharepoint
      the python handles the encoding of the source file which is not standard utf-8 and also ingesting
      from the edm-private s3 bucket.

      There is an extensive writeup in a github issue about DOB NOW custome job filing data
      https://github.com/NYCPlanning/db-developments/issues/386#issue-864138806

      INSTRUCTION FOR DATA UPDATE:
      Must be run with -v flag e.g. library archive -n dob_now_applications -v 20220118
      Since the versioning of this file is based on the date received from DOB so the default version
      given by runtime date won't work.
