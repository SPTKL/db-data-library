      DOB NOW job applications received from DOB via FTP
      the python handles the encoding of the source file which is not standard utf-8 and also ingesting
      from the edm-private s3 bucket.
      INSTRUCTION FOR DATA UPDATE:
      Must be run with -v flag e.g. library archive -n dob_now_permits -v 202200627
      Since the versioning of this file is based on the date received from DOB so the default version
      given by runtime date won't work.
